# Tum Campus App - An Unofficial Guide Through University Life

The TUM Campus App (TCA) is an open source project, developed by volunteers and [available on the App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/app/id1217412716).

It mostly targets phones, but can also be used on tablets or any other device that runs iOS. We also have a [mac app](https://github.com/TUM-Dev/Campus-iOS/releases/lastest). This is the repo for the iOS version of the TUM Campus App.
